Task 3 – CNN for Digit Classification (MNIST)

Internship Project - Machine Learning (CodTech)

Hello! This repository contains the solution to **Task 3** of the CodTech Machine Learning Internship. The goal of this task was to build a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** using **TensorFlow/Keras** to classify **handwritten digits (0–9)** from the **MNIST dataset**.

The deliverable includes:
- A functional deep learning model
- Performance evaluation on a test dataset
- A saved `.h5` model file
- Instructions to use the model for prediction on new images

---
 Objective

To build a CNN that:
- Takes in 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits
- Learns to classify them into one of 10 classes (0–9)
- Evaluates performance on a test dataset
- Can be saved and reused for new predictions

---

 Dataset: MNIST

The [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) is a classic benchmark in machine learning:
- 60,000 training images
- 10,000 test images
- Grayscale format, size: 28x28 pixels
- Labels: Digits from 0 to 9
